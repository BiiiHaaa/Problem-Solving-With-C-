3. Size of Fundamental Data Types

Write a in C++ program to find the size of fundamental data types.

Sample Output:
Find Size of fundamental data types :
------------------------------------------
The sizeof(char) is : 1 bytes
The sizeof(short) is : 2 bytes
The sizeof(int) is : 4 bytes
The sizeof(long) is : 8 bytes
The sizeof(long long) is : 8 bytes
The sizeof(float) is : 4 bytes
The sizeof(double) is : 8 bytes
The sizeof(long double) is : 16 bytes
The sizeof(bool) is : 1 bytes
